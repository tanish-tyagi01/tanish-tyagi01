👋 Hey there, I’m Tanish!

Welcome to my GitHub corner 🚀

I’m passionate about growing in tech, building impactful projects, and constantly leveling up my skills. Around here, you’ll find:

🛠️ Projects I’m building (or experimenting with)

📊 Data & cloud explorations as I dive deeper into analytics and AWS

🌱 Learning notes from my journey of balancing growth, challenges, and curiosity

I believe learning should be fun (even with bugs 😅), and I’m all about sharing insights that can make life in tech a little easier and more exciting.

Whether you’re here to find useful code, swap ideas, or just see how I’m figuring things out—you’re in the right place! 🫶

💻 Let’s connect, learn, and grow—one repo at a time.
You bring the curiosity, I’ll bring the code. ✨
